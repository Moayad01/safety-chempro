    <p class="header-1">Fire Alarm System</p>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Types of Fire Alarms:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Smoke Detectors: Detect smoke particles long before you might see flames.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Heat Detectors: These devices are activated by unusual spikes in temperature and are typically installed in kitchens or mechanical rooms.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Flame Detectors: Ideal for high-risk areas, these detectors identify the actual presence of flames and prompt immediate action.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Core Components:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Control Panel: Think of this as the brain of our fire alarm system. It’s where all the signals from detectors converge.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Detectors: Strategically placed throughout our facilities to catch early signs of fire.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Alarm Sounders: Make sure everyone hears the call to evacuate when triggered.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">How It Works:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Automatically triggers in the presence of smoke, heat, or flames, with manual pull stations available for additional safety.</li>
        <li class="header-3">The alarms sound loudly to ensure everyone evacuates as practiced, and the control panel contacts emergency services.</li>
    </ul>




    <p class="header-1 p-t-60">Gas Leak Detection</p>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Types of Gas Detectors:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Combustible Gas Detectors: Essential in areas where flammable gases are used or stored.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Toxic Gas Detectors:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Combustible Gas Detectors: Essential in areas where flammable gases are used or stored.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Toxic Gas Detectors: Protect against invisible threats such as carbon monoxide.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">System Components:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Gas Sensor: Always on guard, analyzing the air for dangerous gas levels.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Alarm Device: Triggers loud and visible alarms if gas levels get too high.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Activation and Response:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">The system automatically activates if it detects gas levels that exceed safety thresholds.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Upon alarm activation, not only will you hear and see the warnings, but immediate evacuation steps are also initiated.</li>
    </ul>




    <p class="header-1 p-t-60">Emergency Procedures to Follow:</p>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Evacuation Essentials:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">In the event of an alarm, stop everything and proceed calmly to the nearest exit, using stairs.</li>
        <li class="header-3">Help out anyone in need during evacuation, and head to designated assembly points.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Assembly Points:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Clearly marked and located at a safe distance from the building. We'll do a headcount to ensure everyone's safety.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="header-2 p-t-30">Fire Outbreak Steps:</p>

    <ul class="feature-title">
        <li class="header-3">Activate the nearest fire alarm if a fire is detected and notify emergency services immediately.</li>
