            <p class="definition-text">A reactor stands as a pivotal apparatus within the operations of chemical plants, serving as a controlled environment where chemical reactions occur under precise conditions of temperature, pressure, and other parameters. Its primary function lies in catalyzing or facilitating chemical transformations, wherein one or more reactants undergo a series of molecular rearrangements to yield desired products. Reactors are designed to accommodate a diverse array of reactions, ranging from simple to highly complex processes, encompassing synthesis, decomposition, polymerization, and other chemical transformations.</p>
